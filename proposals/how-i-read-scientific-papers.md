# How I read scientific papers

## Brain dump:

### The problem

Reading scientific papers is hard. They are dense, take time, and are often not that exciting.
However there is a lot of great work and information that goes into them. How do we make them
accessible?

### The audience

Self taught programmers, or anyone who struggles with reading scientific papers and needs a hand.

### The idea (the one I have anyway)

- read through the paper's abstract. If there is anything you don't understand, take time -- it's ok
  if the terms are unclear or new to you.

- if the abstract is too complex, or not on a topic you are interested in at the moment, put it
  aside for now. Maybe you will come back to it later

- if the abstract is interesting, great! you can do an initial reading. Give the paper a quick,
  light read. If you do not understand something, feel free to skip it. On the first read you are
  not expected to understand it, just get a sense of the flow of the argument. What did they do? How
  did they do it? Why did they do it? At the end of the quick read, see if you can answer these
  questions. If not, thats fine, you will know later.

- wait a day or so

- do a deep reading. I find this to be the most difficult reading, since there is so much new
  information to process. Also remember to suspend any kind of judgement of the paper or ideas.
  you will be more likely to benefit from the paper if you are not fighting it. this time is going
  to be slower. stop on terms you don't understand, look them up. a good trick is to split the
  paper up and do the reading in parts. if its particularly dense, only do one page, or even one
  paragraph! per day. Monitor how you are reading, if you feel like you are losing focus, pause
  for a bit and come back to it later. Take notes as you go. You will find good secondary reading
  in the citations of the paper. (don't invest too much time in them though, better to just get
  the abstract to give context).

- Cool! Lets go back to the questions, what did they do? how did they do it? why did they do it? If
  you don't have the answers, thats still fine! give yourself a couple of days to let the info from
  the deep reading sink in.

- Third reading time. armed with your notes from last time, read the paper again. this time, ask
  questions if you can. why did the author(s) take the approach that they did, is one example
  question. Are there other ways that you have seen that can solve this problem? What do you,
  yourself think, about what is going on in this paper?

- always take breaks! Probably you have a grasp of the paper by this point. You might want to read
  it again and again, and its worth it!
